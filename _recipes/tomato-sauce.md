# Tomato Sauce

## Notes

- Use fresh spices and herbs for a better taste
- You can skip the sugar if you simmer the sauce for long enough
- If you use olive oil as the base make sure it doesn't burn when cooking the tomato paste
- If you use whole tomatoes you will need to simmer longer, and chop them first
