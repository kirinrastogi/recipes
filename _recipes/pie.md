# Pie Dough

## Notes

- Making any pie crust is hard unless you have experience
- It may go better if the shortening is cold when you start
- Optionally use cold vodka instead of cold water for a flakier crust

### Serves: 1 pie, top and bottom

## ‚è∞ Time

- 5 mins mixing
- 25 mins idle

## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour (300g)
- 1 cup vegetable shortening
- 6-8 Tbsp ice water

## Directions

1. Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl.
1. Cut in the shortening. Use two butter knives. Mixture should look like tiny peas on wet sand.
1. Slowly add ice water until the dough is shaggy. It should be easy to mould.
1. Ball it up, then cover with flower and tinfoil, and let it sit in the fridge for 25 mins before shaping.
