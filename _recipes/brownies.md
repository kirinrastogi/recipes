# Fudgy Brownies

## Notes
- Use mass or weight while measuring sugar and flour
- Aquafaba (chickpea water) is optional
- If you overmix the batter after the flour is added, your brownies will be cakey and tough instead of fudgy
- Brownies keep cooking for a while after you take them out, it is better to undercook them

## ⏰ Time

1hr active + 3 hrs for cooling

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (8oz/227g) imitation butter, melted and cooled
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (6 1/4oz/184g) brown sugar
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (8 1/4oz/244g) white sugar
- 4 tbsp chia seeds, ground
- 3/4 cups aquafaba (or 3/4 cups water)
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup (5oz/150g) all purpose flour
- 1 cup (4oz/123g) good quality, unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cup (9oz/270g) roughly chopped chocolate or large chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) then line a 7x11 inch baking tray with parchment paper and set aside.
1. In a separate bowl, grind chia, and mix with aquafaba. Set aside.
1. In a large bowl combine melted imitation butter, and both sugars.
1. Add the chia, vanilla and salt then whisk for about one minute until evenly combined and light in color.
1. Over the same bowl sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined. Fold in half of the chocolate chunks.
1. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, then smooth the top. Generously top with the remaining chocolate chunks.
1. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies no longer jiggles and is JUST set to the touch.
1. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature before removing from the baking tray and slicing.
